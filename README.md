Project: Evaluate News Articles

---

Overview

---

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence. It focuses on the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, particularly on how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

While creating robust NLP systems often requires extensive resources and expertise, modern APIs like TextRazor make it accessible to everyone. In this project, we will use the TextRazor API to analyze and extract attributes
from articles or blog posts.

Setting up the API

---

To integrate the TextRazor API into your project, follow these steps:

---

Step 1: Register for an API Key
Sign up and generate your API key from the TextRazor website. You can access the documentation and registration page here (https://www.textrazor.com/).

Step 2: Store Your API Key Securely
Create a .env file in the root directory of your project.
Add the following line to store your API key securely:

APPLICATION_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY

Replace YOUR_API_KEY with the actual API key you obtained from TextRazor.

Building the Frontend Assets
Before testing your application, you need to generate the frontend assets:

Run the following command:

---

bash

npm run initiate
This will create the necessary files in the dist directory.

Final Steps
Youâ€™re now ready to start developing and testing!

Use npm start to launch the application and test the API integration.
